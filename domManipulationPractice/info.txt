This is practicing the DOM manipulation exercises at https://www.teaching-materials.org/jsweb/exercises/dom_manipulation_advanced

Start with this HTML and save it as "about_me.html":
  <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
              <meta charset="utf-8"/>
                    <title>About Me</title>
                        </head>
                            <body>
                                  <h1>About Me</h1>

      <ul>
              <li>Nickname: <span id="nickname"></span>
                      <li>Favorites:  <span id="favorites"></span>
                              <li>Hometown: <span id="hometown"></span>
                                    </ul>
                                        </body>
                                          </html>
                                          Add a script tag to the bottom of the HTML body.
                                          (In the JavaScript) Change the body tag's style so it has a font-family of "Arial, sans-serif".
                                          (In the JavaScript) Replace each of the spans (nickname, favorites, hometown) with your own information.
                                          Iterate through each li and change the class to "list-item".
                                          (In the HTML head) Add a style tag that sets a rule for .list-item to make the color red.
                                          Create a new img element and set its src attribute to a picture of you. Append that element to the page.

The Book List
Create a webpage with an h1 of "My Book List".
Add a script tag to the bottom of the page, where all your JS will go.
Copy this array of books:
  var books = [
      {
            title: 'The Design of EveryDay Things',
                  author: 'Don Norman',
                        alreadyRead: false
                            }, {
                                  title: 'The Most Human Human',
                                        author: 'Brian Christian',
                                              alreadyRead: true
                                                  }
                                                    ];
                                                    Iterate through the array of books. For each book, create a p element with the book title and author and append it to the page.
                                                    Bonuses:
                                                    Use a ul and li to display the books.
                                                    Add an img to each book that links to a URL of the book cover.
                                                    Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it or not.
